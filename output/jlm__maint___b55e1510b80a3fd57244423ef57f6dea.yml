# This is the docker-compose.yml for the deployment environment.
# Instead of building the image, it's pulled from Docker Hub.
# The current directory is not mounted.
# Only the assets directory is mounted, and this is only to get round a problem that the asset paths
# as served up by the app are not preceded with ENV['SCRIPT_NAME'].

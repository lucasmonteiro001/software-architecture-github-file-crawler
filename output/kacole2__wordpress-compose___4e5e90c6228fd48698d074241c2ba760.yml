# This wordpress installation is meant to be deployed to a Docker Swarm Cluster
# This will demonstrate how to use data persistence across hosts in a swarm cluser
#   Use rexray to create two volumes called `mysqldata` and `wpdata`. This datastore
#   will persist while containers are created and destroyed across hosts
#
# docker-compose up -d

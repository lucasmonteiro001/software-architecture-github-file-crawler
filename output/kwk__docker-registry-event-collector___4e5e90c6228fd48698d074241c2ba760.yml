# This docker-compose file sets up a database container (MongoDB)
# and the event collector container. The latter is linked to the
# MongoDB container.
# Notice that the name "your-mongo-host-address" is actually
# configured inside the config.yml. If you have your own MongoDB
# server you should remove the link from the event collector
# container and configure the config.yml so that it points to your
# MongoDB container.

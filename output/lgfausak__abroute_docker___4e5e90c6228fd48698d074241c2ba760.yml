# the database is expected to already exist, use
# a command like this to prime a new one:
# docker run -name abdata tacodata/abroute-docker-postgres abinit
# it must exist, not be running, and be named abdata
# this isn't the way to do it, but, I can't figure out
# any other ways to compose it.
# you could:
# docker-compose -f abinit.yml up
# then mount the volume, probably a better way, but it requires more than one 'compose' step
abdata:
  image: tacodata/abroute-docker-db
  # expose only maps the port to a linked container.
  # ports will do expose, + the port is mapped to the host
  expose:
    - "8000"
  # this image has an ENTRYPOINT, we can
  # pass a command which ends up being an argument
  # this argument indicates what port to monitor
  command: "8000"

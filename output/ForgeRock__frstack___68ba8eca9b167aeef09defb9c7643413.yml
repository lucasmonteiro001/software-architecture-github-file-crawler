# Test docker compose for running OpenAM

# Problem: Docker-compose does not wire up OpenDJ DNS name like k8 does. OpenAM can't find its config store..
# We can solve this by putting in the hostname of the opendj server into the containers /etc/hosts
openam:
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"
  volumes:
    - /opt/ois/openam2:/root/openam
  image: wstrange/openam-nightly
  # Put our hostname in containers /etc/hosts so openam can find DJ
  # This is a bit of a hack - but works OK for now
  extra_hosts:
    - "openam.example.com:192.168.56.11"
    - "openam:192.168.56.11"
# This can be used to link to other docker containers- but not the host
#  external_links:
#    - openam
#    - openam.example.com


openidm:
  ports:
    - "9090:8080"

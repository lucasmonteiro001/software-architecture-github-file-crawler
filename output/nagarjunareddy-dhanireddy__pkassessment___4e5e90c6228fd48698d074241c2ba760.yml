# In Jira, general IssueType IDs are associated to various "issue"
# attributes. However, there is one attribute which this collector's
# queries rely on that change between different instantiations of Jira.
# Please provide a numerical ID reference to your instance's IssueType for
# the lowest level of Issues (e.g., "user story") specific to your Jira
# instance.  Note:  You can retrieve your instance's IssueType ID
# listings via the following URI:  https://[your-jira-domain-name]/rest/api/2/issuetype/
#  - JIRA_ISSUE_TYPE_ID=7

# In Jira, your instance will have its own custom field created for "sprint" or "timebox" details,
# which includes a list of information.  This field allows you to specify that data field for your
# instance of Jira. Note: You can retrieve your instance's sprint data field name
# via the following URI, and look for a package name com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.Sprint;
# your custom field name describes the values in this field:
# https://[your-jira-domain-name]/rest/api/2/issue/[some-issue-name]
#  - JIRA_SPRINT_DATA_FIELD_NAME=customfield_10007

# In Jira, your instance will have its own custom field created for "super story" or "epic" back-end ID,
# which includes a list of information.  This field allows you to specify that data field for your instance
# of Jira.  Note:  You can retrieve your instance's epic ID field name via the following URI where your
# queried user story issue has a super issue (e.g., epic) tied to it; your custom field name describes the
# epic value you expect to see, and is the only field that does this for a given issue:
# https://[your-jira-domain-name]/rest/api/2/issue/[some-issue-name]

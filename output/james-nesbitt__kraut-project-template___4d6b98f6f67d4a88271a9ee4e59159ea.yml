  # Servers
  #
  # The following nodes are services that support the application.  Typically
  # the AMP stack is represented, along with any key-value, search and static-caching
  # servers used.
  #
  # It is optimal if the services use generic shared images, that are used across
  # instances, and across applications.  This makes the overally server impact low
  # and means that management tools can focus on the source and asset images

# Configure your config/databases.yml to connect to MySQL hostname "mysql",
# using the credentials below. You have to manually initialize the database
# with the provided fixtures before you can use Policat.
#
# On first `compose up`, you might get errors because MySQL needs to initialize
# itself on first boot and Docker might not be able to properly link the
# containers. In that case, just run `compose up` again.

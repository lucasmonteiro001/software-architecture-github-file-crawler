# We're going to create and use our own network because the default docker
# network uses a 16 bit netmask that overlaps with our internal VPN network.
# I'm not sure why the default network needs 65k addresses, but alas, we'll
# go with our own class C because it won't overlap and we'll be able to hit the
# internal artifactory to download packages from the development channels.
